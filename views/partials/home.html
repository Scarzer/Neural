    <p class="lead"> </br> Hi there! My name is Crae Sosa, and I'm currently a student at the City College of New York studying engineering.  My interests revolve around designing and engineering computer software.  I also like to think of myself as someone with the spirit of an entrepreneur, although sometimes it's misinterpreted as the plights of a delusional engineer in search of food.  I'm currently working on a few business ideas that I hope to release in the very near future.  If you haven't checked out my website yet, please feel free to have a look around! :)
